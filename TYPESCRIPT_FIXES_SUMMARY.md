# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed in InputChatContent.tsx

### 1. Removed Unused Imports
- ❌ Removed `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` (not used anywhere)
- ❌ Removed `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` (not used anywhere)
- ✅ Kept `BEDROCK_MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` and `BEDROCK_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` (still needed for PDF splitting)

### 2. Removed Unused Variables
- ❌ Removed `pushTextFile` from destructured state (not used in new logic)
- ✅ Kept `pushTextFile` in Zustand store definition for backward compatibility

### 3. Fixed Function Declaration Order
- ✅ Moved `handleLargeFileUpload` declaration before `handleAttachedFileRead`
- ✅ Fixed the "used before declaration" error

### 4. Updated Dependencies
- ✅ `handleAttachedFileRead` dependencies: `[handleLargeFileUpload, open, t]`
- ✅ `handleLargeFileUpload` dependencies: `[pushS3File, open, t, props.conversationId]`

## Remaining TypeScript Errors
The remaining TypeScript errors are related to missing React type declarations and are not related to our file upload logic changes. These are likely environment/configuration issues that don't affect the functionality.

## Current Status
✅ All file upload logic errors fixed
✅ No unused variables or imports
✅ Function declaration order corrected
✅ Dependencies properly updated
✅ Ready for testing

The implementation now properly routes all files through S3 storage without any TypeScript compilation errors related to our changes.
